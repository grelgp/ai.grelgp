# Voice Converter

Voice Converter is an experimental web application that lets users upload an audio file and transform the voice into a celebrity's voice. The app runs the RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) model on the server to handle the voice conversion. This project is meant more as a proof-of-concept or personal experiment rather than a production-ready tool.

## Features

- Upload an audio file through a simple web interface.
- Convert the voice to a chosen celebrity's voice.
- Download the transformed audio.
- Self-hosted for private use.

## Notes

This is a fun test project and not intended for production use.
